### üïπÔ∏è Co‚Äëop Netplay & Sync

#### Added

- Clients mirror host animations for both players, keeping swings in sync
- Boss metadata in snapshots so clients always render the active boss

#### Fixed
- Client inputs no longer trigger host player actions locally (authority cleanup)
- CDRZ sprint speed normalized; smoother walk/run animation switching
- TheGuyWho stutter on client during CDRZ jump: gated client-side jump physics and animation; clients follow host snapshots to avoid conflicts
- Depth sorting and feet alignment polished across spawn/resize/respawn

#### Flow
- Non‚Äëautostart co‚Äëop: 1P/2P select, Host/Join, lobby start signal
- Story scene synchronized: host-timed typewriter with matching audio clicks
